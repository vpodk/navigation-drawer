# Navigation drawer

### Key points
- Hidden `<input type="checkbox">` as a toggle;
- Fullscreen `<label>` element for veil;
- Google Material spec for sizes, animations, and colors.

### Accessibility
Implemented with HTML and CSS only, but for A11y it uses few lines of JavaScript:
- Support keyboard navigation (Esc and Enter);
- Prevents page scrolling when the navigation drawer is open.

### TODO
- Only what's missing is the focus bounder :)
